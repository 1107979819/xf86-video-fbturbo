/*
 * DRI2 related bookkeeping for windows. Because Mali r3p0 blob has
 * quirks and needs workarounds, we can't fully rely on the Xorg DRI2
 * framework. But instead have to predict what is happening on the
 * client side based on the typical blob behavior.
 *
 * The blob is doing something like this:
 *  1. Requests BackLeft DRI2 buffer (buffer A) and renders to it
 *  2. Swaps buffers
 *  3. Requests BackLeft DRI2 buffer (buffer B)
 *  4. Checks window geometry, and if it has changed - go back to step 1.
 *  5. Renders to the current back buffer (either buffer A or B)
 *  6. Swaps buffers
 *  7. Go back to step 4
 *
 * The main problem is that The Mali blob ignores DRI2-InvalidateBuffers
 * events and just uses GetGeometry polling to check whether the window
 * size has changed. Unfortunately this is racy and we may end up with a
 * size mismatch between buffer A and buffer B. This is particularly easy
 * to trigger when the window size changes exactly between steps 1 and 3.
 * See test/gles-yellow-blue-flip.c program which demonstrates this.
